 abstract = {Adversarial training is an effective defense method to protect classification models against adversarial attacks. However, one limitation of this approach is that it can require orders of magnitude additional training time due to high cost of generating strong adversarial examples during training. In this paper, we first show that there is high transferability between models from neighboring epochs in the same training process, i.e., adversarial examples from one epoch continue to be adversarial in subsequent epochs. Leveraging this property, we propose a novel method, Ad-versarial Training with Transferable Adversarial Examples (ATTA), that can enhance the robustness of trained models and greatly improve the training efficiency by accumulating adversarial perturbations through epochs. Compared to state-of-the-art adversarial training methods, ATTA enhances adversarial accuracy by up to 7.2% on CIFAR10 and requires 12 ∼ 14× less training time on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets with comparable model robustness.},
